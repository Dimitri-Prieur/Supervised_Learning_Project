# Supervised_Learning_Project

Machine learning applications are becoming more and more widespread for health professionals. Image analysis based on machine learning and deep learning can help health professionals correctly detect, classify, and diagnose their patients. One of these applications is through the study of histopathology, the study of tissue diseases.

Our objective will be to achieve a multi class textures analysis and prediction from colorectal cancer histology. For that, we will also try to determine what features can be used to try to predict as best as possible the classes related for each image.

For that, the dataset contains 5000 images from a collection of tissue types composed of eight main classes: tumor, stroma, complex, lymphoid, debris, mucosa, adipose and empty. Each image being a 150 x 150 x 3 RGB image. They were used in a study conducted in 2016 for the Scientific reports journal.
